# SaaS Platform for Ethical Automation in BPO

This project aims to automate repetitive tasks in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) environments using virtual chat agents. The goal is to reduce employee turnover, improve operational efficiency, and validate the product with companies in Colombia.

---

## Goals and Constraints

1. Reduce employee turnover by automating tedious BPO tasks without compromising customer service.
2. Demonstrate that virtual agents can replace certain BPO processes.
3. Validate the product with Colombian companies.
4. Deliver a final product in 12 development sessions.
5. Each session lasts 1 hour with a clear deliverable to avoid cognitive overload.
6. Pair programming format.
7. No multitasking or off-topic discussions.
8. Chat-only automation (no voice or multichannel support in this phase).
9. Target market: Colombia.
10. All components must be modular and usable independently.

---

## Problem Definition and Objective

- High turnover in customer service roles, especially chat and support.
- Low job motivation among BPO workers due to limited career options.
- Urgent need to automate repetitive tasks and scale solutions.

**Software Objective:** Build a SaaS platform that automates critical BPO functions (e.g., chat support), replaces human tasks with intelligent agents, and adapts to multiple sectors.

**Commercial Product:** Ethical substitution platform for repetitive tasks, with scalable plans based on number of agents, sectors, and chat volume.

**Key Metrics:** Employee turnover and customer satisfaction.

**Target Sectors:**
- BPO (priority in Colombia)
- E-commerce
- Financial services
- Healthcare and education

## Ethical Principles

### 1. Justified Worker Replacement
- Automate repetitive, impersonal tasks.
- Avoid replacing human functions that require empathy or judgment.

### 2. Full Traceability
- Document every technical decision with cause, category, and next step.
- Validate usability, speed, and impact per development cycle.

### 3. Transparency in Agent Usage
- Clearly identify virtual agents to end users.
- No simulation of humanity or emotional manipulation.

## System Architecture

| Component       | Main Function                          | Technology           | Technical Rationale     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Frontend        | User interface, metrics dashboard       | React + Tailwind     | Modular, fast, clear     |
| Backend         | RESTful API, business logic             | FastAPI + PostgreSQL | Scalable, traceable      |
| Virtual Agent   | Chat-based automation                   | Rule-based + LLM     | Ethical, auditable       |
| Database        | Persistence and relationships           | PostgreSQL           | Robust, auditable        |
| Traceability    | Structured logs + emotional audit       | CloudWatch + Custom  | Ethical validation       |

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Frontend (React + Tailwind)

**Features:**
- Chat interface with virtual agent.
- Metrics dashboard (response time, satisfaction, simulated turnover).
- User login with role-based access (admin, operator, client).

**Why React + Tailwind?**
- React enables reusable, fast components.
- Tailwind accelerates design with customization.
- Ideal for MVPs focused on speed and clarity.

---

### 2. Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

**Features:**
- RESTful API:
  - `/chat`: handles message exchange
  - `/agent`: executes agent logic
  - `/metrics`: exposes operational data
- Basic authentication with session tokens.
- Input validation and sanitization.

**Why FastAPI?**
- Fast, modern, Python-compatible.
- Automatic documentation via Swagger.
- Suitable for modular microservices.

---

### 3. Virtual Agent

**Features:**
- Agent selector (rule-based, LLM, hybrid).
- Chat simulation for requests, resignations, technical support.
- Sector-specific responses (BPO, e-commerce, healthcare).
- Configurable per client or industry.

**Why Rule-Based Logic?**
- Enables auditability of agent decisions.
- Prevents opaque or inexplicable behavior.
- Aligns with ethical and reproducibility standards.

---

### 4. Database (PostgreSQL)

**Features:**
- Relational model:
  - `users`: ID, name, role, sector
  - `chats`: ID, timestamp, message, agent
  - `metrics`: duration, efficiency, simulated satisfaction
- Auditable migrations with rollback support.

**Why PostgreSQL?**
- Robust and compatible with advanced analytics.
- Ideal for traceability and complex relationships.
- Integrates well with BI and audit tools.

---

### 5. Traceability and Logging

**Features:**
- Structured session logs:
  - Agent identity, logic used, response time
  - Useful for debugging and external audits
- Emotional audit per session:
  - Cause, category, next emotional step
  - Supports sustainable technical leadership protocols

**Why It Matters:**
- Validates system performance and ethical alignment.
- Facilitates iteration, continuous improvement, and stakeholder communication.
